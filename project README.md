# Mod 4: React Project

For this react project, I'm creating a very simple fruity market app. The goal for this app is to have public user to create a list of market that provides info of what the market is and creating a list of fruits that the market provides & and create a reviev for that spacific market.

For my backend(rails API) of this project, I've created 2 diffrent models: Markes(showing the list of markets), and Reviews(for commenting a spacific market). For these models, Markets has many Reviews and Reviews belongs to Markets.

For my models, I was using mixing two diffrent style of code, for my eletronics, I used objected orented behavior with crud using the read method.

For my frontend(js, html, css) project, what I add some interesting details using CSS code. For this code, I want my buttons to change colors every time I hover my mouse over the button. To make it work, I use '(className:hover)' in css that will allow the mouse to create an effect such as changing color for the electronics and comment buttons. As for JavaScript, I've created "electronics.js" to create a Object Oriented language with a get method. As for the review, I want the users to create, delete, and update a commet to that spacific item using 'POST', 'DELETE', and 'PATCH'.
